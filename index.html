    <h1>Testing how to use Git and GitHub</h1>
    <p> I have just made some changes from the remote</p>
    <p> I think I have a better understanding of how to pull from the remote repo now</p>
    <p>Now I want to make some changes from the local repo and I hope to create a new branch and merge with the master</p>
